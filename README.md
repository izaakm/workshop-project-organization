Project Organization and Data Management
========================================

The goal of this workshop is to:

- address day-to-day organization challenges associated with computational projects
- propose a reasonable strategy for organizing computational projects

This workshop pulls heavily from the ideas presented by Noble (2009).

> Unfortunately, for students who are preparing for a research career, [the
> typical bioinformatics and computational biology] curriculum fails to address
> many of the **day-to-day organizational challenges** associated with
> performing computational experiments....
>
> The purpose of [this workshop!] is to describe one good strategy for carrying
> out computational experiments. I will not describe profound issues such as
> how to formulate hypotheses, design experiments, or draw conclusions. Rather,
> I will focus on relatively mundane issues such as organizing files and
> directories and documenting progress. These issues are important because
> **poor organizational choices can lead to significantly slower research
> progress.** I do not claim that the strategies I outline here are optimal.
