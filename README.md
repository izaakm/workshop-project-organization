Project Organization and Data Management
========================================

Topics
=======

1. What do you want your project directory to store?
    - Lab protocols
    - Primary data, including images 
    - Lists of specimens and reagents 
    - Information about instruments
    - data
    - code
    - documentation
    - tests
1. Conceptual model of your project
    - Where do things go? ... GTD Archive - Use the most obvious "identifier",
      eg, you should be able to find it by looking in at most 2 places.
1. README
1. Project Directory structure
    - an example project directory
    - talk about the files and directories ...
        - README.md
        - .git
        - data
        - code (src)
        - documentation (docs)
        - tests
1. Data categories
    - metadata (data about the experiment; machine or human generated, immutable)
    - raw data (machine generated, immutable)
    - third-party (human generated, immutable)
    - derived (outputs)
    - data dictionaries
1. Data best practices
    - machine generated vs human generated (eg, Excel spreadsheets)
    - naming conventions: unique identifiers for samples
        - see "making-the-right-moves-second-edition.pdf" p 149 for examples
    - unique identifiers for samples
    - about spreadsheets
1. Example: Genomics Core Sequencing data
1. Example: NCBI SRA Data
1. Example: Something more stats/data-science oriented
