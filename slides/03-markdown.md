# What is Markdown?

Simple, text-based formatting instructions (**markup**).

Easy to read in **plain-text** (e.g., in the terminal).


# Headings

Markdown:

```text
# A first-level heading or title
## A second-level heading
```

What it looks like:

<!-- example headings --> 

## A first-level heading or title

### A second-level heading

<!-- end of slide -->

## ... on GitHub


GitHub automatically generates a table of contents at the top of the file, and
you can click a title to navigate to the selected section.
